    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>By popular request, I&rsquo;m sharing my tried and true recipe for the best chewy 
            gluten-free chocolate chip cookies! If you&rsquo;re looking for gluten-free chocolate 
            chip cookies that have crispy edges, are chewy with a bit of a gooey center, and 
            full of chocolate, then these are the cookies for you! </p>

    <h3>Ingredients and Substitutions for this Recipe -- A Detailed Look Before We Go</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Gluten-free Flour Blend:&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had best results making this with&nbsp; 
                <a href="https://amzn.to/2rALZRp" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                 Authentic Foods Multi-Blend Flour</a> or 
                <a href="https://amzn.to/3kHf82s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                 BakeGood Almond Flour Blend</a> or 
                 <a href="https://amzn.to/2SUReUV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                Gluten Free Mama&rsquo;s Almond Blend</a>.&nbsp;I tried with 
                <a href="http://amzn.to/1GJZ1MT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                Cup4Cup gluten-free flour</a> with good results. (Note, usually gfJules is one of my go-to 
                blends, but it is a little too starchy to get the right chewy texture with gooey center in 
                this recipe. It still makes a very good cookie, just won&rsquo;t be as chewy or gooey.) These were 
                good but not great with King Arthur Measure for Measure or Bob&rsquo;s Red Mill. I do not recommend 
                using Maninis, Namaste or Pillsbury gluten-free flour for these. I will update this as I try it 
                with other flour blends as well. Stay away from the blends that have any bean flours.</li>
            <li>If the gluten-free flour blend you choose to use already has xanthan or guar gum already in it, 
                then omit the xanthan gum called for in my recipe.</li>
            <li>Sugar and Brown Sugar: I don&rsquo;t recommend swapping these out, but some people prefer to use 
                coconut sugar for some of the sugar called for in the recipe, just know that it will affect 
                the texture.</li>
            <li>Butter: You can use a non-dairy butter alternative like Melt or Earth Balance if you would 
                prefer. I would still melt it to use in the recipe. Results will vary and will not likely 
                look the same as my cookies, because mine are made with real butter.</li>
            <li>Cream cheese: I have used 
                <a href="https://amzn.to/35krlIN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                Kite Hill plain cream cheese alternative</a> and it worked very well. Use equivalent 
                amount.</li>
            <li>Baking soda: This is NOT the same as baking powder. DO not substitute the baking soda with 
                anything else.</li>
            <li>Chocolate: These are loaded with chocolate so choose your favorite chocolate! Sometimes I do 
                semi-sweet chocolate chips like you see here (usually 
                <a href="https://amzn.to/2WDBgRs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                Guittard</a> or Trader Joe&rsquo;s), sometimes I do a mix of 
                <a href="https://amzn.to/2SLMkuL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">
                semi-sweet chunks</a> and 
                <a href="https://amzn.to/2zg3wSm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">mini chips</a>.
                If you prefer milk chocolate, then use 
                <a href="https://amzn.to/2A9UA1d" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">milk chocolate chips</a>
                in yours.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/4 cups (~282 grams) good all-purpose gluten-free flour</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. xanthan gum* (see note)</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>1 tsp. salt</li>
            <li>2 ounces cream cheese, room temp</li>
            <li>3/4 cups (12 Tbsp.) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp. pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 cups (12 oz.) semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
        <p>*omit xanthan gum if your gluten-free flour blend has xanthan or guar gum already</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together gluten-free flour, xanthan (unless flour blend already has xanthan or guar gum), 
                baking soda and salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of your stand mixer, place the cream cheese, then pour melted butter over it. Add brown sugar and 
                sugar and mix on medium speed for 2 minutes. (I use the paddle attachment on my mixer.)</li>
            <li>Using just egg yolks, no egg whites to help with the chewiness of the cookie. This is an old trick I learned from 
                Alton Brown. I like to use an egg separator so that I don&rsquo;t end up with any stray shells or break the yolks in 
                the process.</li>
            <li>Add vanilla extract and egg yolks (one at a time) mixing on low-medium speed until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Add the flour mixture that you set aside earlier, beating on low until just combined.</li>
            <li>Add the chocolate chips and mix on low or by hand, just until mixed thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate a minimum of 4 hours and up to 4 days.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to bake, remove from refrigerator and allow it to come closer to room temperature so you 
                can scoop the cookies easily before baking.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°.</li>
            <li>Line cookie sheets with sheets of parchment paper or silicone liners. Do not spray!</li>
            <li>Use a #20 cookie scoop to scoop even mounds of cookie dough spaced several inches apart. I can get 12 per 
                cookie sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies for 11-12 minutes at 375°. Remove when edges are set and just browning. The centers will look 
                undercooked, but will continue cooking as they cool. To ensure you don&rsquo;t over bake, I suggest you bake a few test 
                cookies so you can determine the right baking time for your oven. If you like gooey centers, cook less, if you like 
                crunchier cookies, cook longer</li>
            <li>If you&rsquo;d like, you can sprinkle more chocolate chips on them once you remove from oven.</li>
            <li>Let the cookies sit on the cookie sheet for just 2-3 minutes before removing to a cooling rack to finish cooling.</li>
        </ol>
