    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>We&rsquo;ve been enjoying lasagna for years. My dad used to make it at least once a month, 
            and then for Christmas. We&rsquo;ve made some adjustments to this family lasagna recipe 
            that we think you&rsquo;ll love. Including adding in pro-tips and shortcuts for getting 
            your lasagna in the oven quicker.</p>

        <p>With this gluten free lasagna recipe, you can add addition ingredients like chopped 
            veggies, spinach, or other cheese varieties. This lasagna is great as-is but you can 
            definitely customize it to fit your palate.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degree F. Spray a 9 x 13 - inch baking pan with oil; set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook noodles according to package; set aside. Skip this step if you&rsquo;re using oven ready 
                gluten-free lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li><strong>For the sauce</strong>: In a large saucepan cook beef, onion, and garlic until the meat is brown. 
                Break the meat apart as it cooks.</li>
            <li>Add the un-drained tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt and pepper 
                and stir until combined.</li>

            <li><strong>To layer the gluten free lasagna</strong>: Spread a little sauce on the bottom of the pan. Add a layer of lasagna noodles
